Event Attendance Data Mining Project
  
The Society for Information Management Portland Chapter wanted to find the event attendance rate of both current members and non-members in order to improve their member retention and increase new member onboarding.
  
I was supplied raw data from excel files with each SIM event that the organization held from the past 2-3 years. The data included each attendee with their personal, corporate, and contact information. I cleaned the data within each excel file and imported them all into a database I created in Microsoft Access. Each event had its own table with each of the attendees and their information. With this I was able to setup queries using SQL commands within Access to join tables together and find which member or non-member attended which event. I imported the results that the SIM board members requested back into an excel file that housed all members and non-members that qualified to be reached out to by the organization (members needed to be retained if they were not attending, non-members needed to be signed up if they attended frequently). I presented the excel file to the board members with visuals put together in Power BI to show the popularity of each event and the attendees that they should focus their efforts on the most.
  
Software that was used in this project includes Excel, Access, and Power BI.
  
*Files are not attached due to privacy reasons, as this includes personal data from SIM event attendees.
